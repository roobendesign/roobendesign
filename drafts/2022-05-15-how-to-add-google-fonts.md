You want to start off by picking a font.  Head over to the Google Fonts website and choose the font you want to include in your project.

For this project Iâ€™m going to be using the **Roboto** Font Family.

Next your going to want to select which styles and weight of the font you want to include in your project.  To add a style simply scroll through the selection and click on the "select this style +" button located on the right of each style.
