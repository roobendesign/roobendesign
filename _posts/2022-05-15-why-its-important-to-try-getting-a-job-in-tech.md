When I'm working on projects I tend to consume a lot of content about tech.  The reason I do this is because it helps me focus and it keeps me up-to-date on what's going on in the world of technology.

One of the things I often here people interested in getting into the web design/programming/technology space is "how do I get a job/how do I start?" 

The answer to those questions is simple, start building/making things.  Make a website design, create a simple app, write a blog post just do something and post it somewhere, twitter, dribble, facebook.  It helps when you explain your process and why you did what you did.

Even if you don't think it's going to get you immediately noticed having projects is a perfect way of showing potential employers or business partners that you at least know the basics.  

When I first got started I would design mock up websites in Adobe XD and post them on a few of my socials. I had maybe 12 followers and my post would get 1 - 3 likes maximum.  After about a few weeks of inconsistent posting a local developer reached out to me and offered to offload some of his WordPress clients to me.  I couldn't believe it.  Another time I was offered a job by a local tech recruiter to work for NewEgg as a jr website designer. 

So remember even if you don't get a massive amount of followers or likes just keep posting, Try your hardest and someone willing to offer you some money will find it sooner than later.

YOU CAN DO IT
