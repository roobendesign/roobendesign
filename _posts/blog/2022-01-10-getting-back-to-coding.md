After taking a break from coding and blogging for a few weeks I’m back!  

## What I'm Planning On Doing for this Project

I’ve decided to create a set of icons and I’m giving them away for free.  Instead of creating the set of icons and putting them into a .zip file I decided to take it one step further. 

For this project I’m going to be creating a webpage exhibiting each icon on my website.  On top of that I’ve also decided to add a download button that will only appear once you hover over the icon you want.

My biggest challenge for this project was finding the right way to overlay the download button for each icon without making it look off, eventually I managed to work something out with the CSS. 

The reason I chose to make the download button only appear when hovered over was to avoid clutter.  I could have made this easy on myself and added a static download button at the bottom of each icon but I felt that would have taken away from the presentation of the icons

If you’re interested in seeing the final product you can go here, [FREE SVG Icons](https://rooben.design/svg-icons).  This is an ongoing project which means I’ll be adding more Icons soon, so keep an eye out for it.
