One of the biggest problems I had when I first started taking web design seriously was finding clients. 

I had no idea what I was doing.

Up until that point I was able to design and create a website from scratch but the idea of finding someone to give me money for them was something I hadn't even thought about.

## Looking For Answers & Taking A Risk With The Little Bit of Money I Had
I Googled tirelessly for ways to find clients, but being young and self taught made a lot of sound information sound too good to be true.  

After a while of searching I decided I only had two options. 

The first one was to keep creating mock up websites with the hope that someone eventually finds my work and wants to hire me.  

The second was to risk a few bucks and run some ads.

I was eager to jump into the web design space so I opted for the latter.

### Learning How To Use Google Ads and Creating Effective Landing Pages
Now the only problem I had was not knowing how to use Google Ads, or so I thought.  Turns out theirs way more to just running an ad to having a successful marketing effort.

On top of learning how to use Google ads I also had to learn how to create effective landing pages and how to write convincing copy, and everything in between. 

After a couple weeks of fiddling around with Google Ads and learning as much about landing pages as I could I decided to get started.

I made a landing page with some effective visuals and a captivating sales pitch.  Then I filled out the Google Ad forms and pressed submit. Within a couple of hours my ad was approved and went live.

I ran my ad for about a week.  I forgot about the ad for the first few days but was reminded by an email notification from one of my new clients. I checked my email where there were 2 other new emails from clients unopened.  After logging in to my Google Ads account I noticed I had only spent about $75.  I couldn’t believe it, I thought I was wasting my money.  After getting to know them and helping them make adjustments to their websites I made a little over $1200.

If you’re new to website design and you're having a similar problem getting clients I strongly suggest you give Google Ads a try.  


#### Some Advice If Your New To Using Google Ads
For your best results, localize your ads.

That means when you go to run your ad make sure you specify a location.  I recommend you go with cities with smaller population near you.

The reasons for this is because cities with smaller populations tend to have less competition.  

#### What I Learned From This
By taking a risk and spending a few dollars I was able to do more than just make some money.

Not only did I make a decent chunk of change but more importantly I made 3 new business relationships.  From these new business relationships I've made  that have kindly given me references.  Two birds, one stone.

To this day when I’m low on referral work I’ll post some ads.
