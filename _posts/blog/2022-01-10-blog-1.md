Recently I have not been writing a lot of code or blogging, I wanted to take a break to get my thoughts in order.  Now that I’m back I feel a bunch better and I’m ready to jump back into the groove of it all.

My first project back is to create a page on my website to host some icons and offer them free to download.

So far it's been going great, I was having a hard time creating the user expiernence for the page. The main probleem I had was adding an overlay to each icon so that when the user hovered over the icon witht their mouse a download icon would pop up close to the top right of the box it was in.

The main reason I did this instead of just adding a static download button beneath was because 1 it just flat out looks better and 2 was to avoid clutter throughought the page, I really when for that minimalist affect. 

So far I have a few Icons up on the page And in The future
