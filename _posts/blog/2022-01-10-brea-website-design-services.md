Looking for someone to help you with your website?

Hello, my name is Ruben Gutierrez and I am a website developer located in the Brea, CA area. Iâ€™ve been working with computers since I was little and enjoy helping others use technology to improve their lives.  

## How I Can Help Your Brea Business
Below are just a couple ways that I can assist you. If you have any other questions please feel free to contact me.

### Website Development
Every business can benefit from having a website. With a website you can accomplish a lot of the important tasks that come with starting a business.  From finding customers to optimizing the way you run your business. I can help set you up with a website solution that will reflect your business perfectly.

### Web/Graphic Design
Does your website look a bit dated, does it behave oddly, or are you just ready for a new look? The way your website looks matters.  We can work together to create a unique look for your Brea business that presents your brand, products, and services in an elegant and appropriate way.

### Search Engine Optimization 
Looking for customers? Websites are the perfect tool to help get your business found.  With a website you can create content about the industry you're in and optimize it for Google and the other search engines.  With SEO you can even increase your foot traffic from Brea and the surrounding area.

### WordPress Websites

Setting up new software for your WordPress website can get a little tricky.  Whether you need to add some functionality with a plugin or you're choosing a new theme I can help guide you in the right direction. 

### Basic Website Concepts
In order to have a successful website you need to know some of the basics.  Websites and SEO can be difficult topics to follow along with which is why on top of the services that I provide I also take the time to help familiarize my clients with the concepts around it without making it difficult to understand.
