If you are trying to decide on a website solution for your small business and you don’t know if you need a basic HTML site or something more robust like WordPress the world's most popular CMS then consider some of the following questions.

## How  many pages is your website going to require?

If your website is smaller, less than 7 pages, and is not going to require a whole lot of functionality outside of some buttons and contact forms then I recommend getting a simple HTML/CSS website.  

If you're going to require multiple pages and more functionality (Sign In/ Online Store/Content Funnels) then a WordPress website is most definitely the answer.

## How often do you plan on updating your website?

If you need to constantly be updating your website and adding new content then WordPress is the better option.  The way WordPress was designed makes it easy for anyone to publish and edit new content.  Its intuitive interface can help save you money by publishing your own content rather than needing to contact a website designer every time you need to post new content.

If just having a decently designed website with some contact and basic information is all you really care about then investing in a simple HTML website is the way to go.  With a simple HTML website you can deploy your website and have it live for years to come without ever really needing to do maintenance.  One of the pros of having a simple HTML website is that it usually tends to just work.  Its simple architecture makes it almost impossible to break unlike more robust technologies like CMS’s (WordPress) that require constant maintenance.

One of the cons that comes with owning an HTML site is that not every website designer can work on it.  New CMS technologies like WIX or SQUARESPACE don’t really require a lot of hard coding.  This shift in website design has made it slightly harder to find designers that are familiar enough with the basics (HTML/CSS/JS) to make source code edits.  

## Are you going to want to add content to your website?
If you want the ability to add content  to your website than the better choice for you is WordPress.

WordPress has such an easy to use interface that anyone can learn how to add content and make edits.  It takes less than an hour to learn the basics about posting. 

## How much do you plan on spending on your website?
If your looking for something simple and and your only trying to spend a one time fee than a simple HTML website is the better option.  

On the other hand if you want something that has a lot more bells and whistles then WordPress is the better options.  Generally speaking it costs about $5 - $10 a month to buy hosting space on a server to run your WordPress website.
